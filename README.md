Symon Say's Game, Using front end web development tool (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
"Simon Says" is my creation, developed using front-end web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This digital version of the
classic memory game challenges players to replicate sequences of colors and sounds. Through a user-friendly interface, players can
enjoy different difficulty levels and engaging features, all accessible on various devices. This project showcases my proficiency in
front-end web development while offering an enjoyable way for players to enhance memory and concentration.
